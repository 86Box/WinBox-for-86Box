# WinBox-for-86Box
#### The newest way to manage the oldest computers.

This program has been created to simplify the way I use [86Box](https://github.com/86Box/86Box) x86 emulator. 

Currently this software is the successor of [WinBox Reloaded](https://github.com/laciba96/WinBox-Reloaded).

**It's most noticeable features are:**
- It automatically updates the emulators from Jenkins.
- It collects all your VMs in a slick brand new list, with some customization options.
- It has a very user friendly UI.
- It has a template based virtual machine creation wizard, which makes life so much easier.
- It has a collection of around 2000+ vintage hard disk geometries, so you can use any of them to your hearts wish.
- It has a real time performance monitor so you can check if you're running too many machines at once.
- It has a built in GUID based storing system for your machines, so you don't have to be aware of folder naming schemes.
- It has a large collection of custom made icons.
- It can create floppy images, and VHD and IMG hard disk images.

**The program currently supports these display languages:**
- Hungarian (hu-HU)
- English (en-US)
- Italian (it-IT)

If you want to add your language to the supported list, you can find the language files under the Translations folder.
These files are simple UTF-8 encoded C-style escape sequenced INI-files, can be created by any kind of text editor.

If you want to translate the progam to your language, you can find a guide in the Wiki section. If you got stuck with it, feel free to ask questions.
Add your new language as a pull request and I most probably include it with the next release.
